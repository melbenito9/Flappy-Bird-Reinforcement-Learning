## Flappy Bird Game with Reinforcement Learning (SARSA)

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques, specifically SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action), to train an agent to play the classic Flappy Bird game. The goal is to investigate the effectiveness of the agent's performance in navigating through the game environment and achieving high scores.

The Flappy Bird game environment is a side-scrolling arcade-style game where the player controls a bird, guiding it through a series of obstacles by tapping to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. The agent learns to play the game autonomously by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards based on its actions.
